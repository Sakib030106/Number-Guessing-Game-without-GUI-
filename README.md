# Number-Guessing-Game-without-GUI-
This is a number guessing game using Python. The funny story is I don't use Pygame module in here. I just make a very simple game without Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).  In this game you just have to guess a number (between 1 to 1000). Random module of Python use in here. Hope you like it. xD..
