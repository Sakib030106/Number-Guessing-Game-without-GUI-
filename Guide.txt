# This is a simple number guessing game using Python.

Hello Everyone! Welcome to this repository done by Sadman Sakib. 
This is a number guessing game using Python without Graphical User Interfaces(GUI).
The funny story is I don't use Pygame module in here. I just make a very simple game without Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).
In this game you just have to guess a number (between 1 to 1000). Random module of Python use in here.

Have a nice day.
